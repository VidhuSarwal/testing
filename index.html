            THis is a sample paragraph I made to fill the space. Doesnt matter
            anyways what the content goes as this isjust for testig<br />
            now i just showed you how to use breakline and why does my IDE not
            have wordwrap enable by default?
        </p>
        <center>
            Now this paragraph should appear in center. Note that the corret
            spellings are center and not centre. I love yapping and irritating
            people so much I might just call it a hobby now.
